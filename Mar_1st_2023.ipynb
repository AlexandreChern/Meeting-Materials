    "#### Parallel Implementation of an Adaptive, Multigrid Solver for the Implicit Solution of Nonlinear Parabolic Systems, with Application to a Multi-Phase-Field Model for Tumour Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract: The first half of the paper provides an overview of a new engineering software tool that is designed for the efficient solution of problems that may be modeled as systems of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) of parabolic type. Our tool is built upon the PARAMESH library, [15], which provides hierarchical mesh adaptivity in parallel in two and three dimensions. Our discretizations are based upon cell-centred finite difference schemes in space and implicit multi-step methods in time (primarily the second order backward differential formula (BDF2)). This results in the need to solve a nonlinear algebraic system at each time step, and we have implemented an optimal nonlinear multigrid method based upon full approximation scheme (FAS). The second half of the presentation illustrates the application of this new software framework to a challenging application, namely a multi-phase-field model of tumour growth [18]. We show some typical simulations for growth of the model tumours, and these results demonstrate second-order convergence in both space and time. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges of obtaining highly scalable parallel performance for a software tool that combines both local mesh adaptivity (requiring efficient dynamic load-balancing) and a multigrid solver (requiring careful implementation of coarse grid operations and inter-grid transfer operations in parallel).\n",

    "#### Tractability of Complex Control Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract: This thesis is divided into two main parts. In the first part, we consider the problem of efficiently computing wavefront estimates for use in adaptive optics hardware on ground-based telescopes. Our contribution is to enable wavefront estimation for future large telescopes. To this effect, we have developed a warm-started single-iteration multigrid algorithm that performs as well as conventional vector-matrix-multiplication methods, but at a fraction of the computational cost. We used numerical simulations to compare our algorithm to a variety of other published methods, and validated our findings at the Palomar Observatory. In the second part, we consider feedback control subject to an information constraint. Such problems are called decentralized, and are not always tractable. Using a novel algebraic framework, we are able to prove many structural results, including a new convexity result, in a natural and purely algebraic way. This framework is particularly well-suited for analyzing systems described by rational transfer functions. We also develop a new condition called internal quadratic invariance, a condition under which the controller synthesis can be cast as a convex optimization problem. This describes the most general class of tractable decentralized control problems known to date. The key insight is that the system's representation is not unique; and choosing the right representation can make determining tractability easier. Both parts of the thesis fit into the broader question of tractability of complex systems. In the first part we look at a practical example which is difficult because of the large number of sensors and actuators. In the second part, we look at decentralized control, which is difficult because of the non-classical information constraint.\n",

    "Figure 3.5: Convergence plots comparing simple multigrid (MG), with conjugate gradient methods using either a multigrid (MG-PCG) or Fourier-domain (FD-PCG) preconditioner. MG methods use Gauss-Seidel (GS) or Jacobi (J) smoothers. The pair (ν 1 ,ν 2 ) is the number of pre-and post-smoothing steps. Most methods converge in a few iterations with comparable computational effort. We averaged 1000 independent runs.\n",
