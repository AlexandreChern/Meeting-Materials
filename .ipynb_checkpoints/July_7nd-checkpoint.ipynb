    "The benchmark seems to give a memory allocations for all intermediate allocations that will be recycled. But I want to measure the maximum memory allocation for a piece of code because the size of the system that is solvable given system memory is restricted by this. I got this result when the system memory that I required is only 128 GBs, and from slurm job information, the maximum memory allocation is only around 18 GB\n",

    "### More complex examples on multithreading in Julia\n",
    "There are some basic simple multithreading examples in Julia. Since multithreading with @spawn was introduced after Julia 1.3, before that it was tested @threads. I was trying to find more multithreading examples in a complex setting but failed. I tried to re-write some part of the SBP code to include multithreading techniques, but got errors from Julia that I couldn't really understand well. It would be great to have some more materials explaing new multithreading mechanism in Julia with complex problem settings"
